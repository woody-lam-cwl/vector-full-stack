## Part I - Front End

Prerequisite: `npm` required to run the code locally.

After cloning the repository, run `npm install` in project directory (`~\full-stack-app\`) to install dependencies locally.

Then, run `npm start` to host project [locally on port 3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Part II - Back End

Prerequisite: `python3` required to run the code locally.

After cloning the repository, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in project directory (`~\server\`) to install libraries locally.

Then, run `python server.py` to host API server [locally on port 8000](http://localhost:8000).

Backend server is required to allow cards to display on frontend - hardcoded data has been removed.

Detailed API documentation can be found in [Backend Documentation](documentation/backend.md)
